/*
 * Redesigned 12/22/04... Yes... this file sucks.  I basically am going to
 * do a few things here.  I have been stuck on this file for the past 2 weeks,
 * trying to come up with some ideas to handle the hopeless situation which
 * faced me.  With the new queue system, this timer class became very interesting
 * to handle.  I had to decide how I would add proc queues to the queue class
 * to handle specific timers in this file.  Say, for instance, that a timer
 * is added, and then another is added that has a shorter time than that one.
 * The first one will have a proc queue added into the queue class, but then
 * the second one will have to add another proc queue.  But hold on a second,
 * the way this works right now, after a timer is done running, the next one
 * is added to the process queue.  I handled this by keeping track of how
 * many processes were in the queue, and didn't add one if there were more than
 * one, and the call to setCurrentTimer was from handle().  This worked, unless
 * you have a timer that repeats.  Then the problem comes in, as it will not be
 * added to the proc queue until the next timer is complete.  To just handle 
 * this problem, I'm just going to add a proc to the queue for every timer
 * that is added, and then every timer will have a queue in the procqueue.
 * that way, we don't have to worry about anything.
 *
 * Also, I added a "timerStack" so that I could have reserved names and what
 * not.  Each timer gets a unique name or ID, and that is added to the stack,
 * as well as sorted into the timerList.
 *
 * Okay, way that timers are handled... has changed, if you want a timer to 
 * repeat, you must return true from the timer, runOnce was removed.
 *
 * Ooohh oohh ohh! Idea.  screw linked lists and shit.  I'll just add each
 * timer to the proc queue, and then have them call handle() with the timer
 * referenced! This solves all problems, and is incredibly more efficient!
 * This officially takes the last linked list out of my bot.  I have NO IDEA
 * why I even used them in the first place, as php already has associative arrays
 * which are a lot better! GEEZ!
